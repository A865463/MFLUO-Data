# MFLUO-Data
we make publicly available a new database MFLUO: a micro-organisms database, for which the task is to detect small object at low magnification on fluorescent images. The interest of MFLUO is that it is usually hard to identify and classify micro-organisms due to their very small size and simple morphology.
